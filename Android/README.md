# attend for Android
This is the Android version of attend. It was created by [@skyus](https://github.com/karimhasebou) (Please contact him for more information).

# Requirements
The app itself requires Android 4 or higher.

Use Android Studio 2.2.3. The SDK used was Marshmallow, so try that.

This uses many dependencies, and they are all listed in build.gradle. Nearly all of them are under the Apache 2.0 license.

This application, however, requires Google Play Services, and thus cannot run on fully FLOSS Android environments.

There should be no problem updating any of them so long as APIs have not changed.
