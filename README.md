# attend
attend (formerly miniAttend) is an platform for mobile and the web that intends to make taking attendance in classrooms a quick process, as it should be.

attend innovatively uses projectors in classrrooms to display a QR Code, that, when used in conjunction with attendees' smartphones, records their attendance.

While the application is certainly a bit barebones and the UI may be a bit messy, it is functionally complete.
